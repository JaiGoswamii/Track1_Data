AI-Based Autonomous Car Simulator ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

Overview:
This project focuses on an AI-powered autonomous car simulator that integrates lane line detection and self-driving capabilities using computer vision techniques. The system leverages OpenCV and deep learning models to detect lanes and make driving decisions in a simulated environment.
